# Biodiversity-in-National-Parks
Interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks. 
Use data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are 
any patterns or themes to the types of species that have become endangered.

Some objectives the project is going to investigate: 
1. What is the distribution of conservation_status for animals?
2. Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
3. Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
4. Which species were spotted the most at each park?
